Hello!

This is a dock which allows you to place a BlackBerry Playbook and iphone 5/5s/se side-by-side to make a clock/calendar/weather device for your nightstand. 

You need both devices using the included CAD files. Additionally, you will need some material to use as a backplate. Holes are included for mounting. 

I have not printed this myself, however it should be dimensionally accurate. 



Enjoy!
